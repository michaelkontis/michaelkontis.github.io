I am a data scientist with a B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Athens. My primary interest lies in artificial intelligence and its potential to foster innovative ideas, develop new applications, and optimize processes.

Additionally, I am always interested in exploring new concepts and topics within Physics, Mathematics, Data Science, and their applications. If you share these interests and would like to discuss them or collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
